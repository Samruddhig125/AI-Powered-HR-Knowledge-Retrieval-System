#AI-Powered HR Knowledge Retrieval System
##ðŸŽˆ Hackathon Project | Built with: Streamlit, LangChain, Ollama, PDFplumber, Chroma

Overview
This project is designed to revolutionize information access and decision-making in HR departments by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system provides natural language querying over PDFs, offering real-time, context-aware responses to streamline HR processes and improve the employee experience.

Key Features
Centralized Knowledge Repository

Upload and index HR documents into a vector database for easy access.
Natural Language Queries

Employees ask questions in everyday language to get relevant answers.
Context-Aware Responses

Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver precise, reliable answers based on uploaded documents.
Use Case: HR Knowledge Retrieval for XYZ Company
The HR department at XYZ Company faces challenges like:

Information Silos: Scattered documents across systems
Slow Decision-Making: Limited access to consolidated data
Employee Confusion: Inconsistent policy communication
This project tackles these issues by making HR information accessible through natural language interfaces.
